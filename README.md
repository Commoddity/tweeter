# Tweeter Project - Pascal van Leeuwen

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

My implementation incorporates much of the knowldge I have acquired in my time in boot camp so far, including:

- AJAX requests
- client-side Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS styling
- flexbox
- responsive layouts
